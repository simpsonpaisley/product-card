### What I learned

I used this project mainly as a jumping in point for an extended break from coding to refamiliarise myself with CSS. When making this project, I realised I have forgotten more than I had thought, so a lot of the best practices have not been used here.

### Continued development

To refine this project, I would like to improve the responsiveness, as at certain breakpoints, it doesn't look very good. I would also like to refine the CSS and HTML, and make sure I haven't kept any redundent code in. I would also improve the accessibility, and use some more best practices.
